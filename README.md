**Habit Tracker Project**

A compact, single-page Habit Tracker that allows users to:

Add custom habits

Set repetition goals

Choose frequency (e.g., Daily)

Track and manage habits easily

📝 What Does It Do?

The app allows users to create and manage habits with custom settings:

Habit Name: User-defined activity (e.g., Reading, Exercise).

"#" of Repetitions: Number of times the habit should be completed.

Frequency: Determines how often the habit repeats (e.g., Daily).

Add Habit: Stores and displays the habit in the list for tracking.

The interface is clean and minimal, focusing on usability and simplicity.

⚙️ How Does It Work?

Single-page structure: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Form handling: Captures user input values from text fields and dropdown.

Event-driven logic: Clicking the “+ Add Habit” button triggers habit creation.

Dynamic DOM updates: New habits are rendered instantly without refreshing the page.

Lightweight implementation: No external libraries — pure JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
